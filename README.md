## What It Is

Trento Live Activity is a civic-tech web platform that lets citizens explore the city in real time and take part in its social life. On the map they can see parking availability, crowding levels at public spaces, upcoming events, and spontaneous activities created by other citizens. They can join activities, propose new ones, and get personalised notifications based on their interests.

The Comune di Trento gets a dedicated analytics dashboard for monitoring urban activity trends and exporting statistical reports.

## Architecture

The backend follows a **microservices pattern** with a central REST API Gateway. The frontend communicates exclusively with the gateway; internal services are not directly exposed.

```
Frontend WebApp
      │ REST
      ▼
 API Gateway
      ├── Auth Service          (OAuth, SPID, 2FA, JWT/RBAC)
      ├── Activity & Event Svc  (CRUD, participation, notifications)
      ├── Map & POI Svc         (real-time IoT, geocoding)
      ├── Notification Svc      (FCM push, SMTP email)
      ├── Moderation Svc        (DSA-compliant report flow)
      ├── Analytics Dashboard   (stats, PDF/CSV export)
      └── Data Layer            ──► PostgreSQL
```

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component breakdown.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- PostgreSQL ≥ 14
- npm ≥ 9

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<org>/trento-live-activity.git
cd trento-live-activity/backend

# One-shot setup: creates PostgreSQL user/db, .env, runs npm install
npm run setup

# Start the development server (creates tables automatically)
npm run dev

# (Optional) populate the database with sample data
npm run seed
```

The setup script needs `sudo` access (for PostgreSQL user/db creation) and assumes PostgreSQL is installed and running.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWT tokens |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` | Apple OAuth client ID |
| `FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY` | Firebase Cloud Messaging key |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server configuration |
| `MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Maps API key (optional if using OSM) |
